# SupermirrorRefAbs
The code calculates reflectivity and absorption of a neutron multilayer Ni/Ti supermirror as a function of transverse momentum of incident neutron.
Interfacial roughness and fluctuation of neutron incident angle and transverse momentum are accounted according to a procedure outlined in detain in:
